<p>Petra, ancient city, centre of an Arab kingdom in Hellenistic and Roman times, the ruins of which are in southwest Jordan. The city was built<br> on a terrace, pierced from east to west by the Wadi Mūsā (the Valley of Moses)—one of the places where, according<br>to tradition, the Israelite leader Moses struck a rock and water gushed forth. The valley is enclosed by sandstone<br>cliffs veined with shades of red and purple varying to pale yellow, and for this reason Petra was called by the 19th-century<br>English biblical scholar John William Burgon a “rose-red city half as old as Time.” The modern town of Wadi Mūsā, situated adjacent to the ancient city,<br>chiefly serves the steady stream of tourists who continue to visit the site.</p>

<p>In c. 220 B.C., under Qin Shi Huang, sections of earlier fortifications were joined together to form a united defence system against invasions<br>from the north. Construction continued up to the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), when the Great Wall became the world's largest<br>military structure. Its historic and strategic importance is matched only by its architectural significance.</p>
